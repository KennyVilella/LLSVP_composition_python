Documentation for the LLSVP_composition_python repository
=========================================================

This package calculates the seismic anomalies associated with a large range of potential LLSVP compositions.
The comparison of the calculated seismic anomalies with observations allowed to constrain the potential composition of LLSVP.

This implementation followed the model described in:
"Constraints on the composition and temperature of LLSVPs from seismic properties of
lower mantle minerals" by K. Vilella, T. Bodin, C.-E. Boukare, F. Deschamps, J. Badro,
M. D. Ballmer, and Y. Li

A quickstart guide is available on the :doc:`quickstart`, while :doc:`api` provides a thorough description of all functions.

.. note::

   This project is still a work in progress and the first fully working version has not yet been released.
