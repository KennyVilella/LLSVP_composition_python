API: Calculation of seismic anomalies
=====================================

This subpage contains the API documentation for the python file `_seismic_anomalies.py`.

The main objective of these functions is to determine the seismic anomalies of a rock assemblage relative to the ambient mantle for a wide range of mineral compositions.
The function :ref:`_calc_seismic_anomalies <calc_seismic_anomalies>` reads the files generated by `_calc_mineral_composition` and calculates the density and seismic wave speeds anomalies for each composition.
The seismic anomalies are expressed as relative differences in percent.
The function :ref:`_calc_seismic_properties <calc_seismic_properties>` is responsible for determining the density and seismic wave speeds of a single composition.

It is important to note that the calculation of S-wave and P-wave seismic velocities is considered less reliable compared to the calculation of density and bulk sound speed.
Further discussion on this topic is available in the associated article.

The results are written into new files with the name of the input file appended with "_processed".
The simulation cannot be resumed, as it is expected to be a relatively quick calculation.
